Then the user will be directed to a new page where they may enter the note title and note text. Once both note title and text have been entered, a "Save Note" button will appear in the upper right corner of the page. A "Clear Form" button can also be found in the upper right corner of the page. If the user clicks the "Save Note" button, the note title will appear in the list on the left side of the screen.
